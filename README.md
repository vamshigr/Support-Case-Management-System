Developed a simple REST API along with a frontend using ReactJS and Redux where customers can log in and raise support tickets. The system helps track issues and lays the foundation for a full-featured support platform.

Current Functionality:

Client Side:

Customers can sign up and log in.

Raise new support tickets.

View, track, and close their tickets.

Frontend built using ReactJS with Redux for state management.

Future Scope:

Admins can log in and assign tickets to agents.

Agents can log in, view assigned tickets, update status, and search tickets.

Add chat between clients and agents.

Extend the React frontend to include admin and agent portals.
